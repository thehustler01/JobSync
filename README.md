# JobSync

Using this project we can get all the job openings which are relevant to our skillset in one platform present in multiple job portals and career sites.
Here, users just have to upload their resume in our web application and using test extraction and web scraping they will get details of all the job vacancies in a single place.
It provides a one step solution to prepare for job interviews, access new opportunities,  improving your resume score and landing your dream job.
